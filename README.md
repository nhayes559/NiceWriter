This is a small writing application I’ve been working on. It’s written in javascript, using the lightweight MVVM framework Vue.js, and deployed as a desktop application with node-webkit.

I often get bored of the same themes in writing applications, and so this has been written with that in mind. 

There’s a demo version hosted at www.nickh.me. Although it’s not primarily designed as a web app, maybe there’s a future for it here… one of the perks of building it as one. The demo uses local storage to save themes, so using lots of high quality images as backgrounds is not advised… but otherwise knock yourself out!

To try the real thing out on your desktop, you should npm install node-webkit, then run nw . in the project root.

#Features

(If you’re into negative reinforcement writing—I’m looking at you writeordie—there’s a tamer version here via the timer and life bar).
